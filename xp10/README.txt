There are three .R files associated with Figure 2 of the main article, named
* BEST-ROPE-example.R
* BEST-ROPE.R
* DBDA2E-utilities.R
The file to open first (in R or RStudio) is BEST-ROPE-example.R. The other two files are called when BEST-ROPE-example.R is executed. Therefore the other two files must be in the same working directory as BEST-ROPE-example.R. Please see additional instructions in the initial comments imbedded in the files.
